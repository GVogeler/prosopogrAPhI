  Standard500ErrorResponse:
    description: An unexpected error occurred. I'm not sure if we need this in the API as a 500 could occur anytime and for many reasons 
                 and should normaly not expose the reason to the public. The typical message would be something like the standard 
                 "Internal Server Error".
